        <p>
            Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer<br>
            Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game.<br>
            Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient<br>
            Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage<br> 
            the administration of a city. Each role provides<br> 
            a different ability and strategy. However,<br> 
            one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players<br> 
            must be constantly aware of betrayal<br> 
            and double-cross. This card game provides a ton<br> 
            of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players<br> 
            and expansion packs available for larger parties.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must<br> 
            carefully choose his or her roles and<br> 
            the strategies can quickly change with the turn<br> 
            of a card. However the level of randomness is<br> 
            just right and cunning and resourcefulness can<br> 
            overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not<br> 
            recommend this game unless there are at least 4<br> 
            players; less than that reduces the intrigue<br> 
            and some of the game appeal.<br>

                    <p>
                        Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is<br>
                        just about perfect and each player must<br>
                        carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the<br> 
                        strategic possibilities are nearly endless,<br> 
                        the game is simple to learn. The replay value is<br>  
                        high and gets even better when you replace<br>  
                        some of the cards with new cards available in the<br>  
                        expansion packs.<br>

                    We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2<br> 
                    to 6 players and we can strongly<br>
                    recommend the game. The different phases of the <br>
                    game are interesting and intriguing, from<br>
                    bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. <br>
                    With the variety of cards and <br>
                    scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's <br>
                    a great introduction to the world of <br>
                    strategic board games and role playing.<br>
