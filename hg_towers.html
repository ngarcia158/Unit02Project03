                Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer<br>
                Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game.<br>
                Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient<br>
                Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage<br> 
                the administration of a city. Each role provides<br> 
                a different ability and strategy. However,<br> 
                one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players<br> 
                must be constantly aware of betrayal<br> 
                and double-cross. This card game provides a ton<br> 
                of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players<br> 
                and expansion packs available for larger parties.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must<br> 
                carefully choose his or her roles and<br> 
                the strategies can quickly change with the turn<br> 
                of a card. However the level of randomness is<br> 
                just right and cunning and resourcefulness can<br> 
                overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not<br> 
                recommend this game unless there are at least 4<br> 
                players; less than that reduces the intrigue<br> 
                and some of the game appeal.<br>

                <p>
                    Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is<br>
                    just about perfect and each player must<br>
                    carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the<br> 
                    strategic possibilities are nearly endless,<br> 
                    the game is simple to learn. The replay value is<br>  
                    high and gets even better when you replace<br>  
                    some of the cards with new cards available in the<br>  
                    expansion packs.<br>

                <p>
                    We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2<br> 
                    to 6 players and we can strongly<br>
                    recommend the game. The different phases of the <br>
                    game are interesting and intriguing, from<br>
                    bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. <br>
                    With the variety of cards and <br>
                    scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's <br>
                    a great introduction to the world of <br>
                    strategic board games and role playing.<br>
