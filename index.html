            <u>HARPE GAMING HOME PAGE</u><br>

        </H1>
        <p>Welcome to Harpe Gaming. We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:<br>
            <br>
            &mdash;Unplug<br>
            &mdash;Interact<br>
            &mdash;Reconnect<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones <br>
            that bring people together through shared experiences. With <br>
            all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get<br>
            that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the<br> 
            intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around<br>
            a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            We are a local board and card game store located in the<br>
            heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry <br>
            hundreds of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games, historical<br>
            simulations, role-playing games, and so much more.<br>
            If you remember a great game from your youth, we<br>
            probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate<br>
            gaming and the company of good friends.<br> 
            Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out<br> 
            a game from our demo library and start playing. <br>
            We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special <br>
            social events. You'll always find a game to play.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We<br> 
            publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out<br> 
            our reviews of Towers and Temples and Alliance; both<br> 
            new this month at Harpe Gaming.<br>
