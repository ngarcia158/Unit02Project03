        <p>
            Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide<br> 
            the outcome. As one of the world powers<br>  
            battling for supremacy you must lead your country's<br> 
            military drive; but you can't do it alone.<br>  
            You have to form alliances and then betray your<br>  
            allies before they betray you!<br> 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity<br>
            of the strike. Will it be a bombing<br>  
            raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion<br>  
            with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack,<br>  
            move into enemy territory with your forces and win<br>  
            the conflict.<br> 
        </p>

        <p>
            The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake.<br>  
            Buy armaments and develop secret<br>  
            weapons from your country's economic funds and<br>  
            natural reserves, but be sure to save<br>  
            something for the future.<br>

                        The list of war simulation games is long. All of them<br>
                        share similar features including the<br> 
                        formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated<br> 
                        through random draws of a deck or the<br> 
                        roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that<br> 
                        is new or innovative in that regard.<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing.<br> 
                        In fact, I dare say we spent more time<br> 
                        reading and rereading the rule book than actually<br> 
                        playing the game. If you want to read a<br> 
                        book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.<br>

                <p>
                    Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the<br>
                    game play to be robust and engaging. The<br> 
                    rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with<br> 
                    experience in this class of board games, there<br> 
                    is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We<br> 
                    think the battle simulation cards are some of<br>
                    the best we have encountered.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    All of that being said, the competition for this type<br>
                    of game is fierce. There are a lot of<br> 
                    established titles with loyal clients. We're not<br> 
                    exactly sure where Alliance fits in with<br> 
                    that group. It's a good game, but not good enough<br> 
                    to draw our attention away from games like<br> 
                    Battle Tested and Global Conflict.<br>

                    Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to<br>
                    war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new<br> 
                    ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the<br>
                    investment options give the game a "real world" feel.<br>
