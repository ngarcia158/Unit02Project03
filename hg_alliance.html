                <h4><u>-Tedious and Confusing-</u></h4>
                The list of war simulation games is long. All of them<br>
                share similar features including the<br> 
                formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated<br> 
                through random draws of a deck or the<br> 
                roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that<br> 
                is new or innovative in that regard.<br>
                
                We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing.<br> 
                In fact, I dare say we spent more time<br> 
                reading and rereading the rule book than actually<br> 
                playing the game. If you want to read a<br> 
                book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.<br>
