                <h4><u>-Tedious and Confusing-</u></h4>
                The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
                share similar features including the 
                formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
                through random draws of a deck or the 
                roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
                is new or innovative in that regard.
                
                We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
                In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
                reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
                playing the game. If you want to read a 
                book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.
