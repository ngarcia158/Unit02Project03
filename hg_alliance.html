                        The list of war simulation games is long. All of them<br>
                        share similar features including the<br> 
                        formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated<br> 
                        through random draws of a deck or the<br> 
                        roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that<br> 
                        is new or innovative in that regard.<br>
                        <br>
                        We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing.<br> 
                        In fact, I dare say we spent more time<br> 
                        reading and rereading the rule book than actually<br> 
                        playing the game. If you want to read a<br> 
                        book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.<br>

                <p>
                    Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the<br>
                    game play to be robust and engaging. The<br> 
                    rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with<br> 
                    experience in this class of board games, there<br> 
                    is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We<br> 
                    think the battle simulation cards are some of<br>
                    the best we have encountered.<br>
                    <br>
                    All of that being said, the competition for this type<br>
                    of game is fierce. There are a lot of<br> 
                    established titles with loyal clients. We're not<br> 
                    exactly sure where Alliance fits in with<br> 
                    that group. It's a good game, but not good enough<br> 
                    to draw our attention away from games like<br> 
                    Battle Tested and Global Conflict.<br>

                    Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to<br>
                    war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new<br> 
                    ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the<br>
                    investment options give the game a "real world" feel.<br>
